0,Sky’s Government Engagement Policy,"Principles
Across the Sky Group, our Government Engagement Policy is underpinned by the following guiding principles:
? Sky engages with governments, their agencies and representatives in order to communicate about
matters relating to Sky’s business.
? It is a necessary requirement of all those engaging with governments on Sky’s behalf (including third
parties) to act within our guidelines for transparency and accountability and the Company’s
standards of responsible business outlined in Sky’s Ways of Working document.
? Sky does not make donations to political parties.
Accountability
Across the Sky Group, the responsibility for government engagement lies with the Public Affairs and Policy
Team. The Group Director of this team is directly accountable to the Chief Executive, who are both
accountable to the board. The board is responsible for the direction and oversight of Sky plc on behalf of its
shareholders and is accountable to them, as owners, for all aspects of Sky’s business. The board recognises
that in conducting its business, Sky should be responsive to other relevant constituencies.
We uphold a commitment to conducting our business fairly, with respect, honesty and integrity. We expect
that any employee or third party will maintain high standards of ethical behaviour and transparency and
raise any concerns as early as possible – this process is outlined in our group-wide Whistleblowing Policy.
Sky has a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption as outlined in Sky’s Ways of Working document.
Transparency
We share our industry expertise to contribute to discussions with the UK government on a range of public
policy issues. We respond to public consultations from various government departments and accept
invitations to appear before select committees, parliamentary groups and policy panels to outline our
insights and perspectives on industry issues.
Members of our senior public affairs and policy teams respond to requests for information about our policy
positions, provided doing so doesn’t compromise commercial sensitivities.
Donations
Sky does not make donations to political parties and we do not allow employees to knowingly make any
political contributions to individuals or political parties on Sky’s behalf. In cases where Sky employees are
unsure whether something may be seen as a political contribution, the Company Secretary is able to give
advice. Sky have never employed or made payments to a serving politician.
Senior management have oversight of all expenditure on public policy activity by Sky’s Public Affairs and
Policy Team. These controls undergo regular monitoring to ensure that all expenditure, including payments
to approved third parties, follow appropriate due diligence.
Third Parties
We get involved at a local, national and European level and through a number of trade organisations. When
engaging with any third party or intermediary, partners are required to comply with both the appropriate
regional laws and Sky’s own Ways of Working. At Sky we constantly regulate any activity with third parties to
ensure they are acting in the company’s best interest at all times. Sky will terminate any membership that
breaches our core values or that no longer aligns with our policy objectives.
The partnerships we foster with public policy groups including industry trade bodies are an important part
of our public affairs activity, therefore we aim to ensure that Sky is working with credible and respected
organisations that align with our company’s core values and meet the following criteria:
1) The group has a robust governance processes
2) Funds provided by Sky will not be misused in the form of political contributions or for other
inappropriate uses
3) The membership continues to provide value to our organisation
4) The group has a consistent and credible reputation with other key external stakeholders
A regularly updated, comprehensive list of the organisations Sky currently has membership with is as follows:
? The Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB)
? Advertising Association
? Internet Watch Foundation
? Media Smart
? Commercial Broadcasters Associations (COBA)
? Tech UK
? European Group of Television Advertising (EGTA)
? Internet Service Providers’ Association (ISPA)
? Broadband Stakeholder Group (BSG)
? The Independent Networks Cooperative Association (INCA)
? UK Competitive Telecommunications Association (UKCTA)
? Parliamentary Internet, Communications and Technology Forum (PICTFOR)
? UK Spectrum Policy Forum
? Business Consumer Coordination Group
Conclusion
We believe this to be a full record of the Sky Group policy towards engagement with government. We make it
publicly available on our website to all members of staff alongside all other key governance policies.

1,UK Tax Strategy,"This policy statement covers the UK operations of Comcast Corporation (the “UK Group”) including the
Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky businesses, and is intended to satisfy the UK tax strategy
publication requirement under Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 2016.
The tax strategy of the UK Group is to comply fully and with the highest integrity with UK tax laws
whilst aligning our tax planning with business objectives to create and protect shareholder value in a
tax efficient manner. The tax planning undertaken by the UK Group seeks to reflect the commercial
realities of our complex and dynamic business operations. In order to carry out the UK Group strategy
we partner with the business divisions to ensure they are supported and advised of potential tax costs,
benefits and risks of proposed transactions and throughout implementation, whilst at the same time
ensuring appropriate information is obtained to fully discharge the UK Group’s compliance
requirements. In so doing we refrain from engaging in schemes that lack an independent business
purpose. We will however, claim properly available allowances, deductions, reliefs, credits and
incentives in conjunction with our tax planning.
We provide this support to the businesses by recruiting sufficient, highly trained, experienced staff
specialising in both tax and finance matters. We are committed to conduct our tax affairs to the
highest standards and in line with the Comcast Code of Conduct and to comply with all applicable
anti-bribery, money laundering and anti-tax evasion legislation. We foster an open, honest and
constructive relationship with tax authorities whom we deal with. We strive to ensure that all filing
positions are supported by strong technical grounds and, where clear, in the spirit of what the law is
understood to have intended. Such positions will be robustly defended if challenged.
Managing tax risk
The UK Group pro-actively manages, reviews and reports on tax risks and employs an experienced tax
team, primarily based in the US & UK, which is part of the central finance function reporting to the
Chief Financial Officer.
The UK Group tax department is accountable for day-to-day management of tax matters, unless
accountability is clearly devolved and accepted elsewhere. Any decisions to be made in respect of
uncertain tax issues will be subject to diligent professional care and judgement by the tax group, but
also after consulting with and justifying the decision with local and international management teams.
In those situations where the level of uncertainty is high the tax group will utilize outside advisors to
help evaluate the risks.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Comcast Corporation receives a regular report as to
material changes in tax legislation that may impact the UK Group as well as details of uncertain tax
positions. In the rare case of significant material issues arising, these issues will be presented to the full
Board of Directors of Comcast Corporation by the Head of Tax.
Working with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)
Despite following the above principles it is inevitable, in such a fast changing international
environment, that there will be instances where there is a degree of uncertainty and hence tax risk in
relation to transactions or activity.
2 I UK Tax Strategy (As of December 2022)
Tax advice will be sought from external advisors in relation to material uncertain transactions or where
the tax department does not have the level of expertise required in a particular area. Any tax opinions
received are an aid to, not a replacement for, professional judgement to be exercised by the team.
Where appropriate, best practice solutions will be sought or such issue may be discussed with the tax
authorities, as the best way to avoid costly disputes is to reach a consensus on issues in advance. Filing
positions not supported by a strong technical position are not adopted.
The UK Group aims to foster an open and constructive relationship with HMRC. We engage in regular
communication in advance of commercial transactions, or soon thereafter, where there are areas of
material uncertainty as to the correct tax treatment. We have engaged with HMRC’s Large Business
Risk Rating Programme, assessing the risk of material misstatement of our UK tax liabilities, and have
continually received either a low or moderate risk rating commensurate to the complexity of our
business operations.
As part of this engagement, we will seek to play an active role in the design of future tax policy and
legislation to meet the UK Group’s commercial aims, through participation within industry associations
and by engaging with HMRC on its legislative consultation initiatives."
2,Human Rights Policy,"Sky respects the rights and wellbeing of everyone we impact through all our activities. This includes our employees
andcontractors, customers, viewers, people who feature in our broadcasts and programmes, workers in our supply
chains and visitors to our sites and the communities around them.
Our approach
Our approach to human rights is based on the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour
Organisation Conventions, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Children’s Rights and
Business Principles. Through our membership of the Responsible Business Alliance we are committed to a common
Code of Conduct, supporting and collaborating on key human rights of workers and communities worldwide
affected by the global electronics supply chain. Through our membership of the United Nations Global Compact
we are committed to making a positive contribution to support human rights and a just transition to net zero
carbon.
Due diligence
Our human rights due diligence includes policies, risk assessments, integrating effective action, monitoring,
communications and grievance mechanisms. We work to identify and address the actual and potential impacts our
business activities may have on human rights. We review the risks to people and identify salient issues, including
labour rights, freedom of expression, responsible broadcasting, privacy, discrimination and children’s rights. We
also focus on health and safety and environmental impacts to people.
We commit to:

3,Environment Policy,"Sky is Europe’s leading media and entertainment company and is proud to be part of the Comcast group.
Across six countries, we connect our 23 million customers to the best entertainment, sports, news, arts and
to our own award-winning original content. We believe that a company of our size, scale and reach has a
responsibility that goes beyond our business, and into the community. The Bigger Picture is our name for doing
the right thing and doing better in all areas of our business to make a positive impact on society.
We aim to be the most environmentally friendly media company in the world. Environmental awareness is
central to the way we do business, from the embodied carbon and energy efficiencies of the products we
create, to emissions reductions and the elimination of single-use plastics in our operations and supply chain.
Our strategy
Our strategy sets out our objectives and targets, which include:
• In 2020 we announced that we want to be net zero carbon by 2030 across our value chain (our
operations, our supply chain and the use of our products by our customers). By this we mean that
by 2030, we’ll at least halve the greenhouse gas emissions created by our business, our suppliers,
and by the use of our tech products, and start to neutralise all value chain emissions we haven’t
cut yet. From 2030, we will offset this remaining carbon footprint in natural carbon sinks such as
forests, mangroves and seagrass.
• Beyond 2030, we’ll continue to reduce emissions in line with the 1.5-degree trajectory, to achieve
absolute net zero in 2050.
• Increasing energy efficiency and using energy and resources from 100% renewable sources
• Eliminating avoidablewaste and embedding resource efficiency through our commitment to doubling
resource productivity
• As a business and media platform, using our voice to help our people, customers, suppliers and
industry take action to protect and restore our natural environment and tackle climate change
• Maintaining
o our CarbonNeutral® Company status
o our policy of sourcing 100% renewable electricity
o our policy of zero waste to landfill from all Sky-owned and controlled sites
o our policy of recycling 100% of all Sky products returned to us
o our policy of no single-use plastics across our operations, products and supply chain.
Suppliers
Our ethical, social and environmental standards are integral to our culture and key to the way we collaborate
with others. We manage our own operations and supply chain through due diligence, risk assessment, training
and collaboration with suppliers in order to ensure that our policies are complied with. Sky aims to be a good
partner in return, and will work with suppliers with the aim of ensuring that products and services supplied to
Sky are aligned to this policy.
We expect our suppliers to:
• Understand, measure and report their material environmental impacts and put in place steps to
address and ultimately eliminate these impacts, including their greenhouse gas emissions
• Set a science-based target to reduce their greenhouse emissions, which includes a commitment to
halve their emissions by 2030, aligned to efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C
• Identify and assess their short, medium and long-term climate-related risks (physical and transition),
have in place processes for managing climate-related risks and integrate these into their overall
organisational risk management.
• Source materials and resources responsibly, increasingly from recycled and renewable sources
• Be prepared, upon request, to demonstrate the type, origin and chain-of-custody of materials used
in the manufacture of products
• Where relevant, comply with Sky’s wood and paper sourcing and single-use plastic policies
2
And through our Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Business partners and contractual agreements:
• Operate in an environmentally responsible and efficient manner and comply with applicable
environmental laws and regulations
• Support our relevant initiatives
• Extend these expectations to their own suppliers
• Provide relevant reporting on progress, if requested, including disclosing to Sky yearly (on a
confidential basis if desired) their annual Scope 1, 2 and upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas
emissions and climate-related risks.
Implementation, management and communicating progress
Sky’s Group Executive oversee Sky’s strategic responsibility and sustainability approach, policies and related
commitments. The Group Director, Bigger Picture & Sustainability has responsibility for the implementation
and review of the Environment Policy.
To fulfil our targets and commitments we will:
• Maintain an effective governance structure that oversees the review and setting of policy, objectives
and targets, as well as ensuring on-going environmental performance improvements and the
development of employee awareness and participation;
• Continually review and understand the range of environmental impacts and risks arising from our
activities, services and products and where practicable, develop strategies to reduce those impacts,
which take account of our stakeholders’ views;
• Maintain an effective data management and collection tool and ongoing monitoring and improvement
of our data collection systems;
• Comply with regulatory requirements; and
• Embed sustainable purchasing practices, with a particular emphasis on emission reductions, resource
circularity, reducing waste, maintaining the exclusion of ozone depleting substances, preventing the
release of pollutants and encourage the use of sustainably sourced forest-derived products.
In relation to this policy, we will ensure that it is:
• made publicly available
• understood, implemented and maintained at all levels in the organisation and supported by suitable
training
• periodically reviewed to take account of changes in the organisation, legislation, fiscal measures and
stakeholder views
We are committed to transparently communicating progress towards addressing our impact on the
environment to interested internal and external parties, in particular through our corporate website and
annual impact reports"
4,Sky’s Carbon Neutral Policy ,"In 2006, we decided to extend our environmental management programme to become carbon neutral. Tackling climate
change was becoming more and more important, and we chose to take a lead in reducing and offsetting emissions.
Carbon offsetting is compensating for your own, unavoidable emissions by financing an emission reduction project
elsewhere. That finance purchases carbon credits, equivalent to one tonne of CO2 each, which the emission reduction
projects generate and are audited by an independent third-party. These are bought by Sky and then ‘retired’ (i.e.
taken off the market to stop anyone else claiming the same reduction). Offsetting is one of the many tools that we
need to combat climate change because it delivers immediate results and finances low carbon sustainable
development throughout the world that would not otherwise happen. As climate change is a global issue, saving
emissions anywhere in the world will help.
Offsetting is not a replacement for a company doing everything it can to reduce its own emissions directly.
How is Sky carbon neutral?
We follow these three steps to become carbon neutral:
• Measure – We calculate our greenhouse gas emissions at the end of each financial year. To do this we calculate
our CO2e emissions from Scope 1 and 2 emissions i.e. our premises, company owned vehicles and refrigerant use
and Scope 3 emissions including business travel and waste sent to landfill. (See our latest 'Basis of Reporting'
for further information on how we calculate and report our greenhouse gas footprint).
• Reduce – We are committed to avoiding and reducing our emissions before offsetting to achieve our carbon
neutral status. In 2020, we set our ambition to halve our absolute greenhouse gas emissions and become net
zero carbon by 2030 across our whole value chain, which includes our suppliers and customers. We’ve already
halved our emissions intensity across our own operations against a 2009 baseline. Performance against our
targets can be reviewed in our Bigger Picture Impact Report.
• Offset – Each year, we offset our location-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and selected Scope 3 emissions to
make Sky a CarbonNeutral® Company across our operations.
o Scope 1 – Emissions from gas, diesel and steam energy use as well as refrigerant use and Sky
owned/operated vehicle use.
o Scope 2 – Emissions from purchased electricity and district heating
o Scope 3 – Emissions from electricity transmission and distribution, transportation of products to
customers and from customers to our recycling centres, business travel, waste sent to landfill, and from
2019 UK-commissioned productions with a completed albert carbon footprint.
Our emissions include the purchase of electricity for Sky-owned sites from a renewable energy tariff supported by
Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGOs). In reporting our market-based emissions, we follow the WRI GHG
Protocol Corporate Standard and report the emissions associated with the remaining electricity using the grid
average conversion factor.
We calculate Sky’s remaining electricity use from non-renewable sources (e.g. where we do not control the energy
provider) by country. Working with Climate Impact Partners, and in line with the WRI GHG Protocol Corporate Standard
and RE100 Technical Criteria, we purchase and retire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) within the same
market boundary and for the same calendar year (vintage) as the electricity used.
Verification
We follow The CarbonNeutral Protocol, a global standard for carbon neutrality, to ensure our carbon neutral claim is
robust and credible. Our CarbonNeutral® certification, awarded by a third party, includes independent assurance of
our climate action.
2
How we offset our carbon emissions
We invest in projects provided by Climate Impact Partners, the leading experts on carbon neutrality and climate
finance. Each year we purchase offsets for the coming financial year, based on the previous year’s emissions. A buffer
of 5% of Sky’s carbon footprint is additionally calculated and offset. At the end of the year we reconcile the offsets for
the reporting year to ensure that we had purchased the correct amount to cover the emissions for that reporting year.
In line with best practice, Climate Impact Partners match these projects to the period when our emissions were
generated as closely as possible.
Carbon credits are certified against a range of recognised international standards for voluntary GHG offsets, which
determine they are legally attributable, measurable, permanent, additional, independently verified and unique. These
standards are endorsed under the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance (ICROA) code. and include the
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS),the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB),the Gold Standard (GS) and
the UK Woodland Carbon Code (WCC).
Since 2018, we have twinned our offsets with ‘catalyst’ financing in support of further sustainable development, such
as improving local environments for nature and people, or supporting the planting of future natural carbon sinks. For
UK woodland planting, under the UK Woodland Carbon Code, Pending Issuance Units (PIUs) function as a ‘promise to
deliver’ a Woodland Carbon Unit in the future. They cannot be used to report again UK-based emissions until verified
and converted to a WCU, but they do allow companies to compensate for future UK-based emissions as part of the
transition to Net Zero emissions by 2050.

Guidance”"
5,Conflict Minerals Policy,"Sky respects the rights and wellbeing of everyone we impact through our activities. Our approach to the key human rights of workers is set out in our Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Business Partners which we share with our parent company, Comcast, and further underpinned by our Human Rights Policy Statement. Sky produces and sells electronics, which contain mined metals key to many electronics industry technologies. This makes us an end user and customer, via component producers and final product assembly in our supply chain, of metals such as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold which may be sourced from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. This policy sets out our approach to conflict-sensitive sourcing practices and risk awareness for these raw materials, and the standards that we expect our suppliers to adhere to at all times. For the purpose of this Policy, “supplier” refers to any company that has contracted (or is intending to contract) with Sky to supply components or products used in the manufacture or assembly of Sky-branded products from set top boxes, hubs and accessories to our satellite dishes and any new products. 1.1 Our approach We recognise the significant adverse impacts which can be associated with extracting, trading, handling and exporting minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. As an end user of these products, we have a responsibility to protect human rights through our mineral and metal supply chain due diligence and not contribute to conflict. Our approach to responsible sourcing within our minerals supply chain is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Through our membership of the Responsible Business Alliance we are committed to a common Code of Conduct, supporting and collaborating on key human rights of workers and communities worldwide affected by the global electronics supply chain. We are also members of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, which provides tools and resources to help companies verify that sourcing practices are in line with the OECD framework. As detailed in our Human Rights Policy Statement, our due diligence includes policies, risk assessments, integrating effective action, monitoring, communications and grievance mechanisms to ensure we use tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold from responsibly managed sources including those in conflict affected and high risk areas. 1.2 We expect our suppliers to: • Establish and maintain a publicly available policy on responsible minerals sourcing in line with the OECD’s guidance. • Establish due diligence frameworks and management systems consistent with the OECD Guidance, including independent third-party audits of smelters in their supply chain. And through our Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Business partners and contractual agreements: • Comply with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and this policy • Extend these expectations to their own suppliers due diligence practices. • Disclose to Sky yearly (on a confidential basis) updated smelter/refiner information for any tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold used in the production of our parts, materials, components and products. 2 1.3 We commit to: • Exercise due diligence with suppliers of Sky-branded products in line with the OECD Guidance • Provide, and require our suppliers to provide, due diligence information confirming that tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold are responsibly sourced • Provide training to our suppliers on identifying risks, due diligence, and the means to promote increased transparency • Carry out independent third-party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points in the supply chain • Report findings of our supply chain risk assessment to the designated senior management of the company • Adhere to a robust risk management strategy which is consistent with Annex II of the OECD Guidance • As members, work with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to map supply chains and validate smelters and refiners. • Ensure effective grievance mechanisms as an early-warning-risk-awareness system for people to raise concerns, as detailed in our Code of Conduct. • Report annually on our supply chain due diligence via our UN Global Compact Communication on Progress in the form of our Impact Report. Sky’s Group Exec oversee Sky’s strategic responsibility and sustainability approach, policies and related commitments. The Group Supply Chain Director has responsibility for the implementation and review of the Conflict Minerals policy. Sky will engage with suppliers and industry bodies as appropriate to support any necessary improvements and encourage long-term solutions to enable responsible sourcing."
6,FAQs - What to do with your old Sky equipment?,"Make a difference with Sky Give your old Sky product a new life! We can reuse most parts of your old products, and any parts we can’t reuse we recycle. Q: What is the WEEE Directive? A: The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive is EU legislation. It aims to minimise the impact of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the environment by reducing the amount going to landfill and increasing reuse and recycling of old products. One way of doing this is by making producers of electrical and electronic equipment responsible for financing its collection, treatment and recovery, and for retailers of electrical and electronic equipment to allow customers to return their unwanted equipment free of charge. Q: What does the crossed out wheeled bin symbol on Sky Products mean? A: Products with this symbol on it should not be disposed with general household waste. Instead, they need to be collected separately for reuse or recycling. Q: Why can’t I put my old Sky equipment out with my normal household recycling? A: Waste electrical and electronic equipment should only be recycled by specialist companies as they can be harmful to the environment and human health if not treated properly. Materials collected by your general household recycling service are not set up to deal with waste electrical and electronic equipment, so please send your old Sky equipment to a collection site* , or back to Sky. * only for Republic of Ireland residential customers 2 Q: What should I do with my old Sky Equipment A: Old Sky equipment can be reused or recycled, and the good news is that it’s really easy to do. Your options are: 1. Send it to us, for free, and we’ll make sure it gets reused or recycled. Package it carefully, remove any batteries, and follow the instructions at Sky.com/recycle 2. Give it to your Sky engineer the next time that they visit. 3. For Republic of Ireland customers, take it to your nearest local collection site – find one atwww.weeeireland.ie. Q: What should I do with old non-Sky equipment? A: We can help with thattoo. When you buy a new product from Sky, we can take similar ‘like-for-like’ non-Sky equipment off your hands if you want us to. Q: Will it cost me anything to recycle my old equipment? A: Not a penny! If you’re posting it, follow the instructions at Sky.com/recycle. Giving it to a Sky engineer or dropping it off at a collection site* is also free. Q: Why should I send my old Sky equipment for re-use or recycling? A: Electrical equipment should not be disposed of with your general household rubbish as it can be harmful to the environment and human health if it is not treated properly. Plus some parts will still be useful, so throwing them away wastes valuable resources we can return to use. By collecting waste electrical and electronic products separately, we can ensure they are sent for specialist treatment and assessment for reuse or recycling, meeting the necessary environmental standards. We ensure they are disposed of in an environmentally sound way. If a Sky product shouldn’t be thrown away, we’ll mark it with a crossed-out wheeled bin symbol. This means it needs to be sent for reuse or recycling in the ways we mentioned above."
7,"Sky’s wood, paper and cardboard purchasing policy","Sky is Europe’s leading media and entertainment company and is proud to be part of the Comcast group. Across six countries, we connect our 24 million customers to the best entertainment, sports, news, arts and to our own award-winning original content. We believe that a company of our scale has a responsibility that goes beyond our business, and into the community. The Bigger Picture is our name for doing the right thing and doing better in all areas of our business to make a positive impact on society. Thinking about how we impact our environment is a core part of the Bigger Picture. One such impact is through the paper and card we use in all our product packaging plus any direct mail, magazines, marketing communications, and the transactional paper within our offices. We try to minimise this as much as possible, but where we have to use paper, we want to ensure it is purchased from responsible companies and made with timber from forests that have been legally harvested and sustainably managed. We don’t just want to stop at paper and card either – we also want to ensure the same for any wood we purchase, be it timber used in the construction of our offices or TV sets, or the furniture and fittings within them. To help us do this we require that any paper, card or wood supplied to Sky is: • made from recycled paper, or reclaimed timber in the case of solid wood; or • certified, by recognised forest certification schemes, as coming from sustainably managed forest sources. There are two such forest schemes that Sky recognise: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). Sky’s preference is to use recycled paper or paper and wood that has been certified to FSC standards. However, where this is not available, Sky requires paper or wood to be certified to PEFC standards. This policy lays out the specification for those supplying wood, card or paper products to Sky. 2 1.1 Paper and Card Specification Product packaging For all Sky product packaging we use FSC certified sources, and collect the Chain of Custody statements from packaging vendors to provide traceability. Our product boxes all show the FSC logo and the certification number of the supplier. All inner packaging for our products is also FSC certified, although not every tray or card piece will contain the logo. Internal Office Paper For internal office paper Sky will only use paper that is made from 100% recycled fibre. Our preference is for at least 70% of the recycled fibre to be post-consumer waste. Corporate Reports, Direct Mail, Media Inserts, Door Drops, Magazines, and Transactional Mail and associated packaging For all of the above, Sky will only use paper and card that is made from 100% recycled fibre, or labelled as FSC or PEFC certified. Our order of preference is: 1. Paper made from 100% recycled paper (at least 70% of which should be post-consumer waste) 2. Paper labelled as FSC certified 3. Paper labelled as PEFC certified If 100% recycled paper is not available or is not appropriate for a particular use, then our preference would be a paper that is labelled as either FSC or PEFC certified and has some recycled content. 1.2 Wood Specification Wood used in the construction of Sky offices, production sets or other operational sites (this includes materials used during the construction phase only, such as chipboard cladding) Wood used in furniture, fixtures, fittings, and stationary Wood used at any stage of construction, in furniture, fixtures, fittings and any other relevant products should be either reclaimed timber or wood that is labelled as either FSC certified or PEFC certified. 3 1.3 Glossary Post-consumer waste – paper recovered from our homes and offices. (It does not include printer returns or mill broke1 ). Post-consumer materials are finished products that have served their useful lives and would otherwise end up in landfill or incinerator2 . Reclaimed timber – post consumer timber that has been recovered from the market. Pre-consumer waste (the other recycled content) – includes converting scrap (essentially scrap from all processes occurring once the paper has left the mill, e.g. printing, cutting and box making); newsstand returns and printers’ overruns; obsolete inventory from printers and other sources; and also damaged stock2 . FSC – products carrying the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) label are independently certified to assure consumers that they come from forests that are managed to meet the social, economic and ecological needs of present and future generations. PEFC – The PEFC Council (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes) is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental organisation, founded in 1999 which promotes sustainably managed forests through independent third-party certification. The PEFC provides an assurance mechanism to purchase of wood and paper products that they are promoting the sustainable management of forests. Chain of custody standard – operated by both FSC and PEFC: • Holders of the FSC chain of custody standards are able to use the FSC logo on paper/wood products that contain FSC paper/wood • Holders of the PEFC chain of custody standards are able to use the FSC logo on paper/ wood products that contain PEFC paper/wood Recycled content – Sky follows the WRAP definition of “recycled content” which adopts the National Association of Paper Merchants (NAPM) description of “genuine waste”. This is defined as: NAPM “genuine waste”: • Converters waste: paper that has left the mill and is waste from a cutting or slitting operation undertaker to meet a specific commercial order; • Printers waste: printing or unprinted waste collected from a printing operation, which may be either ‘trimmings’ (guillotine waste), ‘overs’, ‘rejects’ or any other similar waste received direct from a printer; and • Domestic/household/office (i.e. post-consumer) waste: waste collected from any of these places, and which may be printed or unprinted. 1 Mill broke is waste produced during the paper making process 2 Source WRAP see: http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/2.%20Recycled%20paper%20content%20definition.pdf"
